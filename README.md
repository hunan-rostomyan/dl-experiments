# Computer design experiments
After writing a simulator of an Unlimited Register Machine (Shepherdson,
Sturgis 1963) in Python, I thought it might be cool to realize a finite
version of the machine using logic gates. That's what I intend to share
here for now: a simulation of URM in Logisim.

The next step will be to realize the machine physically: first on an FPGA and then using chips from 7400/4000 series.
